# Becoming Competitive When Joining a New Company
**25 May, 2024**

## Context
This is a blueprint of how I strive to become competitive when joining a new company. For me, being competitive means:

- Having the ability to contribute to most areas within the company.
- Gaining the respect and stature from both the engineering and business sides, allowing me to earn space and autonomy.
- Reaching a point where I can break soft and hard rules to get things done.

Ultimately, I want to be seen as one of the top engineers, ideally within the first few months.

This isn’t necessarily advice for everyone to follow—every individual and situation is different. However, there are methods in this blueprint that might offer value. Some advice may not apply to those starting out, but you will know better than anyone when to apply them.

## Blueprint Overview
The reason I become effective quickly isn't that I start out with all the right skills. It’s that I’m willing to invest significant time into my work and I leverage strong soft skills to navigate the social and power dynamics within the company. It’s not just about engineering; it's also about understanding the relationships within the company—who does what, why certain things matter, and, importantly, who matters.

I find that I thrive when I have an intuitive grasp of the dynamic interplay between systems, features, and people.

## Core Mindset Components
There are a few key components to the mindset I adopt when joining a company:

- I just joined, and my primary role is to be a valuable tool for the company. I must focus on being serviceable.
- No task is too small, and no person or conversation is beneath me.
- Everything should be tackled directly with clear communication and accountability.
- Speed is key. The faster I can move, the more I can accomplish, and the closer I’ll get to working on the things I truly care about.

When I look back at the process that got me to this point, I see that building relationships, acquiring knowledge, and producing tangible results were the key drivers.

## Pre-requisites and Mindset
When joining a new job, the faster your "onboarding" period is (the time when you’re not yet delivering at full capacity), the better. In many companies, this onboarding period is essentially a trial phase—how quickly you integrate into the company can set the tone for the rest of your tenure.

I focus on immersing myself deeply in the codebase, mapping out systems and their relationships, understanding where data is stored, how it's transformed, and why certain things are done. I read through pull requests (PRs), observe how problems are solved, and trust that my brain will start absorbing the underlying patterns. It’s about the grind and repetition.

In the initial weeks, I use a "blackbox" filter to identify low-signal information. I focus only on what’s important for the task at hand and avoid distractions. If I’m unsure about something, I’ll treat it as a black box until I need to understand it better.

## On Building Relationships
One of the first things I try to identify is: who are the wizards? These are the 20% of people doing 80% of what really matters. It takes time and intuition to recognize them, but some clues include:

- How others speak about them.
- How close they are to the company's core technical or product primitives.
- Whether their work and code reflect excellence.

Once I have a list, I try to get closer. I read their PRs, join their Slack channels, analyze their activity and interactions. The goal is to learn from them, to understand how they think, how they work, and eventually to work with them directly.

I also make lists of key people and their skills, traits, and behaviors. The more data I have, the better my intuition and social calibration become.

Over time, I aim to collaborate with these people on small, well-scoped projects. If they work with me, ideally they’ll vouch for me later. This opens up new opportunities to work on the most valuable and interesting problems in the company.

Sometimes it’s as simple as a shared interest. At one job, I uploaded a custom emoji from a wizard’s favorite anime. Months later, using it in a chat led to conversations, which led to collaboration—and eventually, friendship and major joint initiatives.

Relationships matter on the business side too—from PMs to SVPs. But these are built through authenticity and can't be templated. This part is left as an exercise to the reader.

## Outcomes
After a few months, I usually reach a point where I can work on projects I care about, or I've built up enough trust to trade that for autonomy. My target keeps evolving as I understand more about the company and the people within it.

I don’t necessarily recommend treating your job as a game of min-maxing or letting it consume all your waking hours—but I enjoy it. I don’t want to spend extra time sucking or waiting to be told what to do. I want to contribute meaningfully, with intuition guiding where I focus.

Don’t buy into the negative notion that “if you do more, more will be expected.” That’s exactly what I want—to be asked for more, because it means I’ve earned that trust.

## Final Thoughts
Do the job. Do it well. Do it fast. Do it a lot. Do it with heart.  
Make real relationships—friends if possible, trusted allies at the very least.  
These relationships lead to knowledge, which leads to projects, which lead to influence.  
Rinse and repeat.

Just make sure to stop before you end up in 25 hours of meetings per week. Easy!
